The branded component <SwmToken path="/template/src/screens/Startup/Startup.tsx" pos="45:1:4" line-data="				&lt;Brand /&gt;">`<Brand />`</SwmToken> was added to the startup screen to enhance the visual identity of the application. This helps in creating a consistent look and feel across the app.

# Conclusion

The addition of the <SwmToken path="/template/src/screens/Startup/Startup.tsx" pos="45:1:4" line-data="				&lt;Brand /&gt;">`<Brand />`</SwmToken> component to the startup screen ensures that users are immediately greeted with the application's branding. This small change contributes to a more cohesive user experience by maintaining visual consistency from the moment the app is launched.
